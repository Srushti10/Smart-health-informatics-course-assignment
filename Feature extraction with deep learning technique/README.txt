1.  The dataset used for implementation contains 1500 CT scans images of chest, abdomen and head.
2.  CNN is applied to extract features from the CT scans images.
3.  KNN and Random forest algorithm is applied on the extracted features to determine model's optimal performance including             hyperparameter tuning.
